The function local.storage() saves the saved data in the local storage in your Browser.
The data is used to save your settings and your Actions so the Website can remember if you already had an Budget. If so, the Website immediatly Switches to the Budget-analystic-site and you must not set a New Budget everytime you reload the site. 
You can check your local storage in your Browser:
 go to the developer Tools in your sidebar. Click storage. (Works in chrome)
